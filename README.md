This is the app that we, team Kamikazey built during participation in Smart India Hackathon 2019, for Cisco DevNet. The project used Cisco's Meraki IoT enabled camera which detects number of people and build an App using Flutter to systematically present data to user and do predictive analysis to suggest the user based on those values whether the person should visit the place or not. The eco system also provides voice based queries about queue data and suggestions, on Alexa and Google Home. It also has an admin-side implementation, wherein the admin can get notified about conditions of queue in organizations through automatically generated e-mails and also, multi-language SMS support.
